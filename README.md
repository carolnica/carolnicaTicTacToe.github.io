This is a Tic-Tac-Toe project I've made.
Largely explaining the way I went about working on the project:
- I created cells in which to to assign either an "X" or a "O" depending on whose turn is to play;
- I assigned variables to each of those cells in order to be able to identify them individually;
- I then used conditionals to check which player won and how it did that.
NOTE: In order to keep track of whose turn is to place the sign in the cell, I've created a variable that holds a value indicating the last sign placed.
